            <h3>Code Liniting</h3>
            <p>
                A linter helps to validate code you've written and flag any style errors 
                found on the website. It's different from a validator because it catches mistakes
                that are technically allowed, but are not correct due to coding standards.

            <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Unit testing is done by importing a file into a test file using a testing framework or assertion library to write tests. In order to run the tests, you need use Node. 
                This is done because it ensures that code meets quality standards before the website or application is deployed.

            <p>
                For this website I am using the framework Mocha for my unit testing.
                I pass in an array of different numbers and I am checking to see if 
                the array contains a nine, if it does the test fails.
