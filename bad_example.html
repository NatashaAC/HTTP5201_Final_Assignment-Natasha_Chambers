            <h3>How to Violate a Security Practice</h3>
            <p>
                In order to violate the sensitive data exposure security practice, 
                you should use the method GET instead of POST for a form. All of the user information will be displayed in the URL, 
                which is easier access for you. If you are sending the information to be stored within a database 
                do not encrypt the names, passwords, or credit card information. 
                This will make it easier for you and others to understand the information within the database. 
                Also collect a lot of information from the user, 
                the more you collect the easy it is to sell to third parties. 
            </p>
            <h3>How to Remedy a Security Practice Violation</h3>
            <p>
                To remedy or correct sensitive data exposure you should encrypt all sensitive information that you receive from the user. 
                For example, debit and credit card information, passwords, and home addresses. This will help to keep the user’s data and your site from getting hacked. 
                Make sure to get an SSL certificate and to make all connections enforce TLS. Setup a Strict Transport Security header. 
                Do not expose any sensitive data on your website. For example, displaying a user’s all of a user’s credit card information on a page that is not secure. 
                Hackers can easily grab that information and use it to buy what they want, which is bad for your user.
